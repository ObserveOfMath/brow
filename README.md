# Brow:
> *For all your terminal browsing desires *â„¢.

# Details:
- Write `brow "something something something"` and pipe it through `less` (if Unix-like systems) and a parsed result list will appear fetched from the `summary` of duckduckgo's search engine.
- Write `brow -ht "something something something"` as a shorthand form of `how to something something something`.
- IMPORTANT: Change the first line of `brow/install.sh` from `cp brow "...."` to `cp brow "/usr/bin"` or update your `$PATH` variable to install it in other directory.

# Needs:
- python >=3
- patience
